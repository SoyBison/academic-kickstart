This is an ongoing project to create 4X-style simulations of civilizations in a simulated world. This is intended to be a long-term project, that I will add to over the course of a long period, when I have some free time.

## Some Background:

Rupahistory is a portmantau from the Maori word "rÅ«pahu" meaning "fake" or "liar" and the Greek "historia" meaning history. 

## The Map:

The map will be a hexagonal grid, defined in cubic coordinates. 

## The Output:

The output of a given simulation will be an animation that shows how the simulated cultures change over time. At first this will just be a visual depiction of the map, shaded to show land controlled by the civilizations, as well as changes to the landscape that the cultures make.
