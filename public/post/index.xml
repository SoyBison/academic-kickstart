      <title>ResMem Release</title>

      <description>A user-ready version of ResMem is now available on PyPI! The model included in the package is designed to estimate the memorability of an input image but is not intended for feature space analysis. The model is optimized for accuracy by allowing the ResNet features to retrain. The model included in the resmem package has been dubbed &amp;ldquo;ResMemRetrain&amp;rdquo; for this reason. Statistically, the retrained model performs better than the model where ResNet is as-is, receiving a Spearman rank correlation of 0.</description>

      <title>MemNet: Models for Predicting Image Memorability</title>
      <link>https://www.coeneedell.com/post/memnetch1/</link>

      <description>Memnet1 was an attempt to build a neural network-based model to predict the memorability of an image. This attempt was carried out by Aditya Khosla at the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Labs at MIT to moderate success. It is the most commonly used neural network regression for this purpose, and has been used and cited in many research papers since publication. There are some problems, however. Memnet was built in Caffe, a deep learning framework which has been defunct since shortly after Memnet&amp;rsquo;s publication.</description>

      <title>Blaseball Ticker Analysis</title>

      <description>Introduction In the last week, large swathes of the Internet have been enamored with the simulated sport of blaseball. Blaseball describes itself as &amp;ldquo;baseball at your mercy, baseball perfected&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;ve been describing it as &amp;ldquo;Nightvale-esque simulated baseball with rules decided by a voting system&amp;rdquo;. It&amp;rsquo;s fun, that&amp;rsquo;s for sure. Blaseball saw a boom after being picked up by a number of news outlets, and a number of blaseball users thought &amp;ldquo;now, this is fun, but I want to know it like I know myself&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Introduction Last winter, I worked on a personal project I call ongaku (from the Japanese for ‘music’). This was an attempt to use manifold learning to create a metric space for music. The preprocessing relied heavily on a method called (Valero and Alias 2012). This method was intended to replace Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients. Where Mel Frequency is a logarithmic transformation of sound frequency, in an attempt to simulate human perception of sound.</description>

      <title>Sex, Conspiracy, and Video Games: Urban Legends on the Internet</title>

      <description>Introduction Urban Legends, or Contemporary Legends, are a type of folklore popularized by Jan Harold Brunvand in his book: The Vanishing Hitchhiker: American Urban Legends &amp;amp; Their Meanings. Urban Legends are considered to be the modern continuation of the human tradition of folklore and legends. Folklore does not occur exclusively in so-called primitive or traditional societies, and by studying modern folklore in the same way that we study the folklore</description>

      <title>Research Proposal on Urban Legends and the Internet</title>

      <description>Research Proposal on Urban Legends and the Internet Introduction &amp;ldquo;Urban Legends&amp;rdquo; is a genre we often confer to fictional and semi-fictional stories that circulate through modern communities. Generally this describes stories that few people truly believe, but are still told and retold time and time again. These stories often have common features, they leverage the unintuitiveness of modern life, a sense of distant credibility (&amp;ldquo;This happened to a friend of a friend&amp;rdquo;), and in some cases a sociopolitical call-to-action.</description>

      <title>Color Analysis of Bandcamp Album Cover Art</title>

      <description>Introduction The internet has allowed any artist to share their work with the world, and in many cases be paid for it. This is mostly a recent development, with the creation of online marketplaces, and patronage services. The defining marketplace for the indie music scene on the internet is Bandcamp. Although it has been difficult to find an estimate for how large this marketplace actually is, Bandcamp does report some information about how much money has been spent on their platform.</description>

      <title>Bandcamp Cover Art Preliminary Analysis</title>
      <link>https://www.coeneedell.com/post/bandcamp_prelims/</link>

      <description>Preliminary Analysis This will document the process of doing preliminary analysis on bandcamp album covers. This is part of an ongoing project which can be found here and on github. The goals of this exploration are to look into the viability of using machine learning methods in this setting. Selected methods will be fully automated and utilized for the final analysis. The &#39;./covers/&#39; directory was generated from the album_cover_scrape function.</description>

      <description>This is an ongoing project, full details are availible here and on github
How do indie musicians use visual signs to indicate their subgenre? This exploration will work by gathering album covers from bandcamp.
Running bandcamp_webtools.py will generate the ./covers folder and populate it with files which use the builtin pickle format. Each file has an album cover, and information about that release. This particular analysis uses 1100+ albums from 400+ artists, with a total size of ~ 4 GB.</description>

      <description>Plurals and Machine Learning Using older machine learning models to conjugate English verbs produced rather silly results. These models performed at an acceptable level for many words, but when given nonsense words as an input these models would produce humorous conjugations. For example, we have:
    Verb Human Generated Past-Tense Machine Generated Past-Tense     mail mailed membled   conflict conflicted conflafted   wink winked wok   quiver quivered quess   satisfy satisfied sedderded   smairf smairfed sprurice   trilb tribled treelilt   smeej smeejed leefloag   frilg frilged freezled     Naturally, my girlfriend and I found this hilarious.</description>
